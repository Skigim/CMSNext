⚠️ Critical Issues & Recommendations
🔴 HIGH PRIORITY
1. Performance Optimization
Issue: Potential re-render cascades and state management inefficiencies

Recommendation:

2. Error Boundary Implementation
Issue: No error boundaries found in the codebase

Recommendation: Implement error boundaries

3. Security Enhancements
Issue: Token storage in localStorage

Recommendation: Implement secure token storage

🟡 MEDIUM PRIORITY
4. Bundle Size Optimization
Issue: Potential large bundle from comprehensive UI library

Full Shadcn/UI import without tree shaking verification
No lazy loading for large components
Recommendation:

5. Input Validation & Sanitization
Issue: Limited input sanitization

Recommendation: Implement comprehensive validation

6. Memory Management
Issue: Potential memory leaks in file operations

Recommendation: Implement cleanup and pagination

🟢 LOW PRIORITY
7. Code Organization
Recommendations:

Extract custom hooks from large components
Implement component composition patterns
Add JSDoc documentation for complex functions
8. Testing Infrastructure
Missing: No test files found Recommendation: Add comprehensive test suite
