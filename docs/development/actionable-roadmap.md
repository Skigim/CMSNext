# CMSNext Actionable Roadmap

> Outcome-focused plan derived from the feature catalogue. Updated at the start of each milestone planning cycle or when priorities shift.

**Last Updated:** October 16, 2025  
**Status:** Near-term milestones (30-day window) **COMPLETED** ‚úÖ

## Guiding Principles

- Ship improvements that strengthen the local-first promise before adding new surface area.
- Complete shadcn/ui migration in small, testable slices to avoid long-running branches.
- Pair every feature investment with tests, telemetry, or documentation recovery so the platform stays observable.
- Keep performance and accessibility baselines green; no initiative closes without measuring its impact.

- Add anonymization CLI flag for exports (`--anonymize` strips PII)
- Update seed data scripts to generate anonymized test datasets
- Document import/export workflows in user-facing guide
- Add progress indicators for large imports (>100 cases)

**Dependencies:**
- ‚úÖ DataManager and validation utilities proven stable
- ‚è≥ UX review for error messaging copy
- ‚è≥ Documentation squad for user-facing guides

**Risks:**
- User education ‚Üí Require clear documentation + in-app tooltips
