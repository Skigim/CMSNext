# CMSNext Actionable Roadmap

> Outcome-focused plan derived from the feature catalogue. Updated at the start of each milestone planning cycle or when priorities shift.

**Last Updated:** October 22, 2025  
**Status:** Near-term milestones (30-day window) **COMPLETED** ‚úÖ | Sprint 1 planning complete with 3 quick-win issues

## Guiding Principles

- Ship improvements that strengthen the local-first promise before adding new surface area.
- Complete shadcn/ui migration in small, testable slices to avoid long-running branches.
- Pair every feature investment with tests, telemetry, or documentation recovery so the platform stays observable.
- Keep performance and accessibility baselines green; no initiative closes without measuring its impact.

**Key Tasks:**

- **Issue #42: Make Alert Resolution Notes Required**
  - Add validation to alert resolution form
  - Update UI to show required indicator
  - Add test coverage for validation behavior
  - Impact: Prevents incomplete alert resolutions, improves audit trail
  - Complexity: Low (1-2 hours)
- **Issue #32: Fix Reports Tab Layout**

  - Debug responsive layout issues on mobile/tablet viewports
  - Ensure proper grid/flex behavior at all breakpoints
  - Verify print layout rendering
  - Impact: Restores professional appearance on all devices
  - Complexity: Low (2-3 hours)

- **Issue #37: UI Consistency Pass**
  - Standardize loading states across all views (use Spinner component)
  - Consolidate toast notifications (Sonner patterns)
  - Audit and unify copyToClick feedback patterns
  - Document UI conventions in style guide
  - Impact: Professional polish, reduced cognitive load
  - Complexity: Medium (4-6 hours)

**Dependencies:**

- ‚úÖ Shadcn migration complete (consistent component library)
- ‚úÖ Spinner component available
- ‚úÖ Sonner toast patterns established

**Risks:**

- Minimal - all changes are refactor-safe UI improvements
- No state management or schema changes required

### 2. **Dashboard Insights Expansion** üéØ Sprint 2-3 (Next 2-4 Weeks)

**Outcome:** Rich, actionable dashboard with 6 new tracking widgets providing comprehensive case management insights.

**Key Tasks:**

- **Issue #36: Dashboard Tracking Widgets** (Roadmap Priority)

  - **Alerts Cleared per Day Widget** - Number of alerts cleared each day over the last week (7-day trend)
  - **Cases Processed per Day Widget** - Number of cases processed daily for the past week (7-day trend)
  - **Total Cases by Status Widget** - Chart (pie or bar) showing breakdown of cases by current status
  - **Total Alerts by Description Widget** - Chart grouping alerts by description to identify common patterns
  - **Avg. Case Processing Time Widget** - Metric displaying average time to resolve a case
  - **Avg. Alert Age Widget** - Metric showing average age of open alerts

- Performance profiling for dashboards with 6+ widgets

- Bundle size analysis to ensure lazy loading effectiveness

**Dependencies:**

- ‚úÖ Widget framework complete and proven
- ‚úÖ Telemetry infrastructure ready for performance tracking
- ‚è≥ Phase 4 manual telemetry captures (dashboard load profiling)

**Risks:**

- Bundle growth ‚Üí Mitigate with lazy imports and tree-shaking analysis
- Render performance ‚Üí Monitor via React Profiler, optimize with memoization
- Data staleness ‚Üí Tune refresh intervals based on usage patterns

### 2. **Financial Operations Enhancements** üìã Design Phase

**Outcome:** Per-item changelog and enhanced verification workflows for compliance and audit trails.

**Key Tasks:**

- **Issue #35: Case Summary Generator** (Low-hanging fruit)

  - Build summary formatter extracting key case details (name, MCN, status, dates)
  - Add copy-to-clipboard functionality with toast feedback
  - Design template format (plain text, structured for pasting into external systems)
  - Add to case detail view with clear affordance
  - Impact: Reduces manual copy-paste errors, improves workflow efficiency
  - Complexity: Low (3-4 hours)

- Design changelog schema (timestamp, user, field, old value, new value)
- Surface history in UI (integrate with activity log or dedicated financial history view)
- Expand validation rules:
  - Negative-balance alerts for resources
  - Income/expense ratio thresholds
  - Verification deadline tracking
- Add bulk verification actions (mark multiple items verified)
- Contextual guidance for verification workflows

**Dependencies:**

- ‚úÖ Telemetry ready to monitor autosave timing impact
- ‚è≥ Activity log enhancements for financial event tracking
- ‚è≥ Design review for changelog UI/UX

**Risks:**

- Compliance requirements ‚Üí Coordinate with stakeholders to validate schema meets audit needs

### 3. **Data Portability Improvements** üìã Ready to Start

**Outcome:** User-friendly import/export with clear error remediation and optional anonymization.

**Key Tasks:**

- Extend validation messaging with actionable remediation steps
  - Example: "Missing required field 'mcn' on row 5. Add MCN value and re-import."
- Add anonymization CLI flag for exports (`--anonymize` strips PII)
- Update seed data scripts to generate anonymized test datasets
- Document import/export workflows in user-facing guide
- Add progress indicators for large imports (>100 cases)

**Dependencies:**

- ‚úÖ DataManager and validation utilities proven stable
- ‚è≥ UX review for error messaging copy
- ‚è≥ Documentation squad for user-facing guides

**Risks:**

- User education ‚Üí Require clear documentation + in-app tooltips
- Anonymization thoroughness ‚Üí Audit for hidden PII (embedded in notes, descriptions)
- Import performance ‚Üí Test with 500+ case datasets, optimize if needed

## üöÄ Long-Term Bets (90+ Days)

### **Deferred Until Architecture Refactor** ‚è∏Ô∏è

The following issues involve significant state management complexity and will be **dramatically easier** after the unified DataManager refactor:

- **Issue #38: Bulk Case Modifications**

  - Requires robust transaction handling, rollback support, and multi-record state updates
  - Refactor will provide centralized state machine with built-in transaction support
  - Defer to avoid building complex coordination logic that will be replaced

- **Issue #39: Multi-Category Notes**

  - Requires schema changes (notes currently have single category)
  - Impacts filtering, display, and state synchronization across multiple contexts
  - Refactor provides clearer migration path for schema updates

- **Issue #34: Enhanced Sorting & Complex Filtering** (Partial Defer)
  - Basic sorting improvements can proceed now (simple multi-field sorts)
  - Complex filtering UI (filter builder, saved filters) should wait for refactor
  - State machine will simplify filter application and persistence logic

**Rationale:** Avoid investing in temporary state coordination patterns that duplicate effort and complicate the upcoming refactor. Focus near-term energy on UI polish, dashboard expansion, and features that leverage existing architecture.
