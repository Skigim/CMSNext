‚ö†Ô∏è Areas for Improvement
‚úÖ COMPLETED IMPROVEMENTS
1. Error Boundary Implementation ‚úÖ **RESOLVED**
**Issue**: No error boundaries found in the codebase
**Resolution**: Comprehensive `ErrorBoundary.tsx` component implemented with:
- Toast notifications for user-friendly error messages
- Development error details with stack traces  
- Reset functionality and error reporting integration
- Integrated throughout application with `FileSystemErrorBoundary`

2. JSDoc Documentation ‚úÖ **RESOLVED**  
**Issue**: Limited JSDoc documentation for complex functions
**Resolution**: Complete JSDoc documentation added to `fileStorageAPI.ts`:
- All CRUD operations documented with @param, @returns, @throws
- Usage examples for key methods like `createCompleteCase`
- Enhanced IDE IntelliSense support and developer experience

3. Project Organization ‚úÖ **RESOLVED**
**Issue**: Scattered documentation and cluttered directory structure
**Resolution**: Complete directory reorganization:
- `docs/development/` - Consolidated development documentation
- `docs/migration/` - Migration guides and strategies  
- `archive/` - Legacy code preserved without clutter
- Enhanced `.gitignore` preventing future accumulation

ÔøΩ REMAINING MEDIUM PRIORITY
1. Component Size Management
Issue: Some components are quite large (App.tsx: 964 lines, CaseForm.tsx: 784 lines)

Recommendation: Extract custom hooks and split large components into smaller, focused components
**Status**: Phase 2A-2C planned for implementation

2. Error Boundary Implementation ‚úÖ **RESOLVED - See above**

üü° MEDIUM PRIORITY
3. Bundle Size Optimization
Issue: Large bundle from comprehensive UI library imports

25+ @radix-ui components imported
No lazy loading for large components  
No code splitting implementation
Recommendation: Implement lazy loading and code splitting for large components
**Status**: Phase 3 planned - some lazy loading already implemented

4. Input Validation & Sanitization
Issue: Could benefit from enhanced input validation

Recommendation: Implement comprehensive validation with libraries like Zod
**Status**: Phase 4 planned for implementation

üü¢ LOW PRIORITY
5. Code Organization ‚ö†Ô∏è **PARTIALLY RESOLVED**
**Remaining Recommendations**:
- Extract custom hooks from large components (Phase 2A planned)
- Implement component composition patterns (Phase 2B planned)  
- ‚úÖ **COMPLETED**: Add JSDoc documentation for complex functions

6. Testing Infrastructure ‚úÖ **COMPLETELY RESOLVED**
**Issue**: No test files found 
**Resolution**: Comprehensive testing infrastructure implemented:
- **Vitest 3.2.4** with jsdom environment and React Testing Library 16.3.0
- **61 passing tests** across critical components
- **DataManager**: 38 tests with 95.91% coverage
- **AutosaveFileService**: 20 tests with 33.09% coverage (113x improvement)
- **Complete browser API mocking** for File System Access API, IndexedDB, localStorage
- **Coverage thresholds** enforced at 70% minimum
**Status**: ‚úÖ **COMPLETED** - Major testing milestone achieved
