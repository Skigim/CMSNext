**Status:** Ready to Merge (rebased onto main, all tests passing)  
**Author:** Copilot Agent  
**Branch:** copilot/phase-2-state-management  
**Base Commit:** a0ebce8 (Phase 1 Complete)

**Core Architecture Changes:**

1. **DomainEventBus** (`domain/common/DomainEventBus.ts`)

   - Type-safe event publishing with generic event types
   - Subscription management with automatic cleanup
   - Foundation for decoupled feature interactions (alerts, telemetry, offline sync)

2. **ActivityLogger Service** (`application/ActivityLogger.ts`)

   - Centralized activity tracking with automatic persistence
   - Rollback support for failed storage operations
   - Event-driven architecture preventing state/storage divergence
   - Proper error handling with activity removal on persistence failure

3. **Rich Domain Entities**

   - Case, FinancialItem, Note, Alert classes with encapsulated business logic
   - ActivityEvent for comprehensive audit trail
   - Type-safe entity factories with validation
   - Immutable update patterns

4. **Use Case Layer**
   - CreateCase, UpdateCase, DeleteCase with event publishing
   - Clear command/query separation
   - Consistent error handling patterns
   - Event-driven side effects

**Testing Improvements:**

- +79 new tests across domain, application, and infrastructure layers
- 290 total tests passing (0 regressions)

## 💡 Key Insights

### What Went Well

1. **Multi-track execution** - Parallelizing telemetry/accessibility/widgets accelerated delivery
2. **Comprehensive documentation** - 1,501 lines of guides enables self-service
3. **Zero regressions** - Tight test coverage prevented breaking changes
4. **Code review quality** - CodeRabbit caught 9 issues in PR #29, all resolved

### Challenges Overcome

1. **Widget refresh loops** - Fixed with useCallback memoization and ref-based patterns
2. **React lifecycle violations** - Moved side effects from useMemo to useEffect
3. **Test act() warnings** - Wrapped async operations with waitFor()

### Lessons Learned

1. **Plan before implementing** - Revert-then-implement approach saved time on widgets
2. **Document as you go** - Comprehensive guides written during feature development
3. **Test early and often** - Accessibility testing revealed gaps during development
