Here's a comprehensive audit process for a project using React, TypeScript, and Vite to ensure code quality, maintainability, and performance:

## 1. Code Quality Audit

### Linting:

Use ESLint with TypeScript support to enforce consistent coding standards.
Add plugins like eslint-plugin-react, eslint-plugin-react-hooks, and @typescript-eslint/eslint-plugin.
Example configuration:
```json
{
  "extends": [
    "eslint:recommended",
    "@typescript-eslint/recommended",
    "plugin:react/recommended",
    "plugin:react-hooks/recommended"
  ]
}
```

### Prettier:

Integrate Prettier for code formatting and ensure it works seamlessly with ESLint.
Use eslint-config-prettier to avoid conflicts.

## 2. Type Safety Audit

### Strict TypeScript Configuration:

Enable strict mode in tsconfig.json:
```json
{
  "compilerOptions": {
    "strict": true,
    "noImplicitAny": true,
    "strictNullChecks": true,
    "strictFunctionTypes": true
  }
}
```

### Type Checking:

Run `tsc --noEmit` to perform a full type-check audit without emitting files.
Use Vite's `vite-plugin-checker` to integrate type-checking during development.

## 3. Dependency Audit

### Outdated Dependencies:

Use tools like `npm outdated` or `yarn outdated` to identify outdated packages.
Regularly update dependencies to avoid security vulnerabilities.

### Tree Shaking:

Ensure unused dependencies are removed by analyzing the bundle with tools like `rollup-plugin-visualizer`.

## 4. Performance Audit

### Bundle Size:

Use Vite's built-in `--mode production` flag to analyze the production build.
Add plugins like `vite-plugin-inspect` or `rollup-plugin-visualizer` to identify large modules.

### Lazy Loading:

Implement code-splitting and dynamic imports for better performance.
Example:
```tsx
const LazyComponent = React.lazy(() => import('./LazyComponent'));
```

### HMR (Hot Module Replacement):

Ensure your development setup uses Vite's HMR effectively for faster feedback.

## 5. Security Audit

### Vulnerability Scanning:

Regularly run `npm audit` to check for known vulnerabilities.
Use tools like Snyk or npm-audit-resolver for automated fixes.

### Content Security Policy (CSP):

Implement CSP headers to prevent XSS attacks.
Example CSP for a React app:
```
script-src 'self' 'unsafe-inline'; object-src 'none';
```

### Additional Security Checks:

- HTTPS enforcement in production
- Input sanitization practices
- XSS prevention strategies
- Secure cookie settings

## 6. Accessibility Audit

### Automated Testing:

Use tools like `axe-core` or `react-axe` for automated accessibility testing.
Integrate accessibility checks into your CI/CD pipeline.

### Manual Testing:

Test with screen readers and keyboard navigation.
Ensure proper ARIA labels and semantic HTML usage.

## 7. Testing Audit

### Unit Testing:

Ensure comprehensive test coverage with tools like Jest and React Testing Library.
Target at least 80% code coverage for critical components.

### Integration Testing:

Test component interactions and API integrations.
Use tools like Cypress or Playwright for end-to-end testing.

## 8. Code Organization Audit

### File Structure:

Ensure a logical and scalable folder structure.
Group related components and utilities together.

### Import/Export Consistency:

Use consistent import/export patterns throughout the project.
Prefer named exports over default exports for better tree-shaking.

## 9. Build Optimization Audit

### Vite-Specific Optimizations:

- Enable `build.rollupOptions` for advanced chunking
- Configure CSS code splitting
- Use `vite-plugin-compression` for gzip/brotli
- Implement proper caching strategies

Example Vite optimization:
```ts
export default defineConfig({
  build: {
    rollupOptions: {
      output: {
        manualChunks: {
          vendor: ['react', 'react-dom'],
          ui: ['@radix-ui/react-dialog', '@radix-ui/react-dropdown-menu']
        }
      }
    }
  }
});
```

## 10. CI/CD Integration Audit

### Automated Checks:

- Pre-commit hooks with Husky
- GitHub Actions for automated testing
- Build verification on pull requests
- Automated dependency updates with Dependabot

Example GitHub Action:
```yaml
name: Audit
on: [push, pull_request]
jobs:
  audit:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v3
      - run: npm ci
      - run: npm run type-check
      - run: npm run lint
      - run: npm audit
```

## 11. CMSNext-Specific Audit

### File System Access API:

- Browser compatibility checks
- Permission handling verification
- Error handling for file operations
- Data persistence reliability

### Privacy & Security:

- No data leaves the browser verification
- File System Access API permissions audit
- Encryption for sensitive data
- Clear data deletion methods

### Tailwind CSS v4 Specific:

- Custom variant usage review
- CSS property optimization
- Dark mode implementation
- Component styling consistency

## 12. Error Handling Audit

### React Error Boundaries:

Implement error boundaries for critical components:
```tsx
class ErrorBoundary extends React.Component {
  componentDidCatch(error: Error, info: ErrorInfo) {
    console.error('Error caught:', error, info);
  }
  render() {
    if (this.state.hasError) {
      return <h1>Something went wrong.</h1>;
    }
    return this.props.children;
  }
}
```

### API Error Handling:

- Graceful degradation for network failures
- User-friendly error messages
- Retry mechanisms for transient failures

## 13. Performance Monitoring

### Core Web Vitals:

- Largest Contentful Paint (LCP) < 2.5s
- First Input Delay (FID) < 100ms
- Cumulative Layout Shift (CLS) < 0.1

### Tools:

- Lighthouse CI integration
- Web Vitals library
- Performance budgets in CI

## 14. Compliance Audit

### Data Protection:

- GDPR considerations
- Data retention policies
- User consent workflows
- Privacy policy compliance

### Accessibility Standards:

- WCAG 2.1 AA compliance
- Section 508 requirements
- Regional accessibility laws
