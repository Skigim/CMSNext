# Resilience Verification Artifacts

Store manual verification evidence for autosave and file storage recovery scenarios here. Each subfolder should reference the related release tag and include:

- Annotated screenshots of the autosave badge, toast stack, and connection modal state.
- Console export (`console.log` copy or screenshot) capturing structured `reportFileStorageError` payloads.
- Notes summarising observed behaviour for any deviations from the resilience matrix.

> This directory is intentionally tracked so historical artefacts remain alongside the resilience checklist.
