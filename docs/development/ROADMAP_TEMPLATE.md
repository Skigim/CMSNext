## 📝 Notes

### AI-Assisted Development Model

This roadmap reflects our accelerated development pace with direct AI assistance:

- **Traditional estimate:** 1-2 features per week
- **AI-assisted reality:** 4+ features per week with full test coverage
- **Each week includes:** prep work, features, then refactoring/polish

### Quality Gates

Every feature must:

1. Pass all existing tests
2. Include tests for new functionality
3. Follow established patterns (hooks delegate to services)
4. Be documented in feature catalogue
