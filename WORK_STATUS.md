## ⚠️ **Track 2: Accessibility** - NOT STARTED (0/6 commits expected)

### Required Work:
- ❌ Install `jest-axe` package
- ❌ Configure axe test utilities in `__tests__/setup.test.tsx`
- ❌ Add axe checks to case workflows
- ❌ Add axe checks to financial workflows
- ❌ Add axe checks to notes/dashboard
- ❌ Create `docs/development/accessibility-testing.md`
- ❌ Update `docs/development/testing-infrastructure.md`

**Status:** ⏳ **READY TO START - Agents 3 & 4 can begin immediately**

---

## ⚠️ **Track 3: Dashboard Widgets** - PARTIALLY STARTED (incomplete)

### Problem: Dashboard.tsx imports widgets that don't exist yet!
Dashboard.tsx was modified but widgets weren't created, causing test failure:
```
Error: Failed to resolve import "./widgets/WidgetRegistry" from "components/app/Dashboard.tsx"
```

### Files That Need to be Created:
- ❌ `components/app/widgets/WidgetRegistry.tsx`
- ❌ `components/app/widgets/CasePriorityWidget.tsx`
- ❌ `components/app/widgets/ActivityTimelineWidget.tsx`
- ❌ `hooks/useWidgetData.ts`
- ❌ `docs/development/widget-development.md`

### Action Required:
**REVERT** the Dashboard.tsx changes OR **CREATE** the missing widget files immediately.

**Status:** ⚠️ **BLOCKED - Fix required before proceeding**

---

## 🎯 **Recovery Plan**

### Option 1: Revert Dashboard Changes (Recommended)
```bash
git checkout main -- components/app/Dashboard.tsx
git commit -m "revert: remove premature widget imports from Dashboard"
```

Then Agents 5 & 6 can properly implement widgets and integrate them.

### Option 2: Complete Widget Implementation Now
Agents 5 & 6 immediately create all missing widget files per their prompts.
